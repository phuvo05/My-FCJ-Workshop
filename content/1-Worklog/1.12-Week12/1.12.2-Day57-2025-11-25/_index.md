# Bedrock Updates

- Adds managed open-weight models (Mistral Large 3, Ministral 3 3B/8B/14B, plus other providers)
- Reinforcement fine-tuning: feedback-driven tuning with big accuracy gains without large labeled sets

## AgentCore Enhancements

- Policy controls and quality monitoring for agents
- Improved memory and natural conversations for safer deployments

## Action Items

- Shortlist models for eval (latency/cost/quality vs. current choices)
- Plan RFT experiment for a target task; define feedback signals
- Map required policies/guardrails before enabling AgentCore in prod
