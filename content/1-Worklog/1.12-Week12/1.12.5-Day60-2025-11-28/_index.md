# Graviton5 and Trainium3

- Graviton5: next-gen CPU with improved price/perf for general workloads on EC2
- Trainium3 UltraServers (3nm): higher throughput training/inference at lower cost

## Fit Analysis

- Workloads to move to Graviton5 (web/app, data processing) and expected savings
- Training/inference jobs that benefit from Trainium3 vs. current GPUs/CPUs

## Action Items

- Select 1–2 services for Graviton5 benchmarking; track perf/cost
- Plan a Trainium3 POC for a target model; compare throughput and budget
- Update capacity planning with new instance families and pricing
