During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ) - AWS** from **September 8, 2025** to **November 28, 2025** (12 weeks), I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  

I participated in **multiple AWS cloud computing learning tracks and hands-on projects**, through which I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, AWS services implementation, technical documentation, blog translation, and workshop development**.  

### Key Accomplishments

Throughout the internship, I completed the following major tasks:

1. **AWS Learning Journey (12 Weeks)**: Systematically studied core AWS services including:
   - Cloud Computing Fundamentals & AWS Well-Architected Framework
   - Networking (VPC, Load Balancing, VPN, Direct Connect)
   - Compute (EC2, Auto Scaling, Lambda, Containers)
   - Storage (S3, Glacier, EFS, FSx, Snow Family)
   - Database (RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, Redshift)
   - Security & Identity (IAM, Cognito, KMS, Security Hub)
   - Monitoring (CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudTrail)

2. **FitAI Challenge Proposal**: Designed a comprehensive serverless architecture for an AI-powered fitness application using AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway, SageMaker, Bedrock, S3, Cognito, and more.

3. **Blog Translation**: Translated 3+ technical AWS blog posts from English to Vietnamese, covering topics such as:
   - AWS CodeDeploy to Amazon ECS blue/green deployments
   - Data integration between Amazon SageMaker and Snowflake
   - Amazon GuardDuty protection plans and Extended Threat Detection

4. **Workshop Development**: Created a hands-on workshop on "Secure Hybrid Access to S3 using VPC Endpoints" covering Gateway and Interface VPC endpoints.

5. **Event Participation**: Attended 2 major AWS events:
   - Vietnam Cloud Day 2025 (September 18, 2025)
   - AWS GenAI Builder Club - AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (October 3, 2025)

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
